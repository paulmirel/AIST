import numpy as np

# import backscatter compensated radiance values
# import the raw data cube, after flat field calibration, 
# and after wavelength calibration (if available)

# how to we cope with bandwidth mismatch? Sum? 
# process values, pixel by pixel, by wavelength to radiance values
# units? W/cm^2/nm/sr
